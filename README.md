**Emergency Service Web App**

I was considering applying for a software engineer job at a company called Emergency Reporting. Their a SaaS company catering to emergency services
around the U.S.. From the job description I knew that I'd need skills in PHP, Javascript and SQL. I'm comfortable with SQL, but I had never used PHP
or Javascript. So I decided to create using those languages in order to learn them and to get a better idea of how I'd enjoy similar projects.

I looked throught the company's website and found this screenshot showing how their site creates reports/charts for the user. I thought this looked
like an especially interesting project. I knew that Kaggle had at least a couple datasets related to crimes or other emergencies that were submitted
by municipalities. So I'd be working with similar data as well.
